    # Introduction
    In this task, you will learn how to create and configure a Client SDK Application and then code a web app that enables two users to send messages to each other.

    First, you will create a `Conversation` and two `Users`. Then, you will authenticate these Users and add them to the `Conversation` as `Members`.

    Finally, you will implement chat functionality in your application, including the ability to view and send messages and be notified when new message appearas in `Conversation`.

    The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-android-tutorial-messaging).

    # What's next?

    For the complete version please see the Android Studio project in the `kotlin-completed` folder of the `git` repository you've cloned ([GitHub](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-android-tutorial-messaging)).

    You can do a lot more with the Client SDK. See [Client SDK documentation](/client-sdk/overview).
